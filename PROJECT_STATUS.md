## Environment Setup
Required environment variables:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_google_places_api_key
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
MONGODB_DB=top_contractors_denver
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=your_base_url
```

## Debugging Status
Currently debugging:
1. TypeScript Error in `src/app/(pages)/search/results/page.tsx`:
   - Issue with `NextPage` type compatibility
   - Error: Type '({ searchParams }: { searchParams: { [key: string]: string | string[] | undefined; }; }) => Promise<JSX.Element>' is not assignable to type 'NextPage'
   - Need to resolve the correct type definition for Next.js App Router page components

2. MongoDB Connection
   - Monitoring connection status
   - Checking cache operations
   - Verifying indexes

## Known Issues
- Mock data still showing instead of real results
- Need to verify environment variables in production
- Need to handle API rate limiting more gracefully
- Pagination needs to be optimized for large result sets
- Cache invalidation strategy needs to be implemented
